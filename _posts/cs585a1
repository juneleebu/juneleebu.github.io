I looped through the rows and columns of the image, and used a formula for converting BGR to grayscale. The formula that I used was 0.07B + 0.72G + 0.21R.

I flipped the image horizontally by inserting ::-1 into the "column" parameter for the array "image". Similarily, I flipped the image vertically by inserting the same into the "row" parameter

I split the image into a left and right half by finding the halfpoint of the image from the width of the image. Using the halfpoint, I created the left image by setting the maximum width as the halfpoint and the right image by making the width the difference between the total width and the halfpoint.

I was able to tint the original image by randoming picking a tint between blue, green, and red using random numbers between 0 and 2. 0 was assigned to blue, 1 to green, and 2 to red. Similarily to the method of the blue tint function from lab, I looped through the rows and columns of the image, and manually set the values of the randomly picked color to 255
